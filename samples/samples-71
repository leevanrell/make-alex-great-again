 To be fair to them, they probably didn't want to come up with that one "we need money" line again. Some of them still think they have the right to private guns." â€”Alex Jones, Alex Jones Live Coverage (8 July 2013) [ edit ]
Alex Jones says "We still have to deal with the insane...the mentally ill, the mentally ill, infidels, and everyone in between."
You just can't let people like me exist. "Alex Jones: I Will Never Want To Live In The 21st Century" by Stephen Dunford, The Daily Dot, May 1 2018.
The fact that the MSM are running the story on how the #BenGeraldInCapre #CartoonAntifa narrative is now a widely available alternative news alternative is evidence enough that something is quite clearly amiss with the MSM.
All this "bullying" makes me want to run a suicide bombing!
A man was seriously injured after being hit by a car on I-95 in Portland while hiking on his own in the shadow of 9/11.
You think this guy was going to fight back? Oh man, he was. No.   And even if he was not, that doesn't mean he's an enemy. That means he's not fighting, as in...well, he might be...he might just be a coward or something. I mean he's human...but I don't blame the guy. He got hurt. He got caught. He's a thug. He's a loose cannon.  And I'm sorry but this guy is a dead guy! And he'll never go back to you,  or your family! And you're a piece of shit! I'm not letting people like this exist!
I know people are turning against me but this guy is an everyday criminal. It's not like he's a big badass like those of us who wear uniforms and do the dirt walking. You see, I'm a man. I fought back when I was threatened, I fought back when a bunch of my gang members put up with me for being a coward, I've cursed the Hell out of certain people, and I've cursed them all the way to jail. I'm a human.  So I know I'm not perfect. But I have a certain dignity and   good taste in life, and that's why I'll never run into any more   criminals or rapists and all the rest of them. Okay?
Well, the MSM just wants to go after me, the leftists, and the people I love.
