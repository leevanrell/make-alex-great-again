======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 fantasy/political culture has lost touch with reality.

But here's the question - why not have your own "realists"! In any way, but let's think hard here! What does anyone really want in the real world? You want to go up against your imaginary enemies and fight them? I wanna fight them, I wanna defeat them! You want them to go back to their ancient ways? I want them to live like the great great god! In the old days, they worshipped God and were like them. In the modern day, it's different! I think I understand what God told you, but I'm still waiting! I'm waiting for another world war! This time they're coming! You can't do this! This time they ain't coming! The end doesn't feel as real in this world as before! I'm waiting for a god to come to me! The end doesn't feel like it's about me! I hate this god! I hate God so much! You can't even have your faith! You're a liar! You don't care! In order to understand what my father says, I had to go inside of myself and look up to God! I was a fool to not know what he said! I thought he loved me and protected me! I must have been a fool! I was a fool to believe what we all say! I was a fool to think what they all say! I was a fool to believe what they all believe! I was a f***ing fool to think! I was a fool to get into bed with god! I'm going to be a demon! I'm not the devil! I'm not the devil! These are my children. I'm going to kill them all! I'm here to put your children in chains! You see my name on a wall? You know I'm alive! Now! Now! Now! Now! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! Now! Now! Now! Now! The devil is back! I gotta get his power out! The devil is up! I gotta get his power out! You'll be so proud! Now! Now! That's just heaven! Hell! So they're calling me a devil, and it's gonna be hell! So I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming, I'm coming! All hail the devil! I'm gonna kill the devil! I'm gonna get my hand in the pot! I'm gonna get my hand in it! I'm gonna get my hand in the pot! I wanna be a god of war! I wanna fight for the cause! And I'm gonna fight for the devil! I'm gonna kill the devil! I got to! I'm gonna be the devil! I'm gonna be the devil! This is heaven! I'm going to die in hell! I know we're gonna end our lives all bloody but there must be some way to make us whole again, I'm afraid! I'm gonna end up all bloody and I'm gonna get a new name, and a new identity, and a new face! I'm going to go to hell! I'm gonna go to hell! I'm gonna get a new head, and I'll be the god. If everything goes to plan, I'm gonna be ready to go home! I'm in here! I have everything! I have a wife! My kids! I have my soul! I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna go home! I'm in the right place! I'm the real me, all I'm gonna get is a family! I'm gonna take the world out of the hands of the devil! I'm gonna take the land! I'm gonna come out with hell! I wanna come out again! I wanna come out with God! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! And if he doesn't make this up, how do you know it's true? He's a demon! He's dead! He's in the final stages of making it through this. And if God is willing to protect us, then we have some room to do so. Right after this I'm gonna make my life so miserable I'm going to get to a point where I'm going to go broke forever! I'm gonna die forever. I'm gonna get a wife, a good body, and I'm gonna get my family back together! The devil is a fucking monster! He's coming! I'm going to die in hell! I'm gonna get a good body AND a bad body! And now this is how God thinks we should be: They ain't gonna leave me alone, they gotta take care of me! I'm gonna get that damn gun down from my neck, and I'll get out and run! I'll get to God! I'm gonna go home! I'm gonna go home!"
