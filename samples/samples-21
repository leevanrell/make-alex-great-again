President Trump said Twitter has obtained a copy of an email from President Trump to supporters on Thursday.

Twitter said Saturday that it has obtained a copy of an email sent to President Trump by a "social justice warrior" during the second presidential candidate campaign.

Twitter warned against "infowars."com" and "Fake News," which are "an assault on free speech."

Twitter warned against "infowars."com" and "Fake News," which are "an assault on free speech."

Facebook's chief security officer told Bloomberg via email, "We think it's very interesting that Facebook took the time to go public with that information. The irony of the fact that the Facebooks were exposed exposes and is a violation of the First Amendment." In response to the tweet above, @RealBenSchumer tweeted, "@RealBenSchumer did not tweet the message, so that's why he's been banned from any news source on Facebook, but it's a violation of the First Amendment at its finest. â€” RealBenSchumer (@RealBenSchumer) November 8, 2016

"Infowars" is a major national news network. We will continue to follow them as they launch a new "hate speech" attack.

"Censorship of free speech is a hate crime which the DOJ and Congress passed to protect some hateful speech and/or the President and the military."

"If @RealBenSchumer were to follow along with The Daily Beast in claiming the President protected The Fascist movement, the President of the United States in his office, the President of the United States and his national security would be exposed to the media?"

"CNN may be attempting to run a media smear campaign against our president, but what is it about CNN that makes CNN the target of such vicious and dangerous hate?"

"Real World Report has an interesting and interesting editorial board and they are offering my top four questions to @RealBenSchumer asking why @RealBenSchumer is allowed on the social media platform to speak out against a program of terror and war and how the leftist agenda is conspiring with Democrats to undermine the American people. How many other free speech issues do you think you are under attack at CNN? More than seven dozen?"

"The left are working with social conservatives to force the government into accepting a more leftist agenda. That's a political lie. More conservatives are saying they're going to kill off all Republicans. I can see why. You're going to have a big debate about the future of the Republic. You're going to have a big, deep debate about censorship and civil liberties. What you're doing is putting your political enemies in such high places, and it is disgusting."

The New York Times was critical of the social media platforms "Facebook and Google."

"Facebook is now facing a series of court orders to have its CEO banned by a Silicon Valley tech giant. As an individual, you must choose between liberty or the future of your company. For those who choose to follow Facebook and Google, it is clear that they are attempting to censor the voice of free speech."

"The tech giants like Apple and Facebook, like Google and Apple, are in the business of protecting their business interests while engaging in a political attack of censorship against their own users. #FakeNews @RealBenSchumer @RealBenSchumer #FreeTomTom

The Silicon Valley giants also know that the tech giants have a number of business interests against them, namely, tech giants like Google and Facebook. They are in the business of destroying free speech and freedom. #FakeNews @RealBenSchumer @RealBenSchumer #RealBenSchumer Tweet

Twitter had to block one of its main users in order to prevent him from banning social media users who have already banned social media users of the company.
